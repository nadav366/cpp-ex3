The software contains a map data structure and software that uses the data structure and is
 a spam detector.

HashMap Class-
     I chose to implement the class by a array of vectors containing key and value pairs.
     This is because I have complete control over the size of the table, but it is
     relatively easy to insert and access more pairs of each vector.
     The data structure gives us access to an average time of O (1) and an average
     construction of O (n)
     Each entry and deletion of a value has a check whether the size of the table
     should be re-adjusted, in multiples of two.

     The map has an iterator based on two indexes - of the table and within the appropriate vector,
     so you can easily move and move across the data structure.

    The data structure is a template and can fit any type of key and value.

SpamDetector-
    Software that receives three parameters - a file path containing their suspicious sentences
    and their score, a text file and a score runner to be considered as spam.

    The software is built on three functions -
    First - running everything and printing.
    Reading and analyzing the information file - analyzes the file, checks its validity and
    adds the information to a data map.
    A third function that analyzes the information file and checks the entire database for
    each row.
